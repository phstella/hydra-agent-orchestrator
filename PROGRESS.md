## Decisions Made

| 2026-02-23 | Restructured repo: `research/` split into `docs/` and `planning/` | Separate reference docs from project management; add agent entry points |

## Open Issues

- No implementation code exists yet; repo is documentation-only.
- First implementation work should follow `planning/sprint-1-cut.md` (10 tickets).
